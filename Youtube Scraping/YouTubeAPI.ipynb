      "\n",
      "♟ Pawn: you get 8 pawn pieces. They are located at the front row as the small pieces. The first ever move you make with all those piece, you can choose to move forward one space or 2. But only on the first move of every pawn. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rooks: you get 2 rookies. These are located in the corners of the board. They look like a castle. These pieces can be moved as far as you want front, back,right,left but never diagonal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Knights: you get 2 knights. knights are located right next to the rook piece. These look like horses. With this you can move one square one way and then 2 squares another way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bishop: you get 2 bishops. Bishops are next to the knights. This piece has a slit in the top. It kind of looks like a frown (opposite to a smile). \n",
      "\n",
      "The queen: you get 1 queen. The queen is located next to the bishop on any side (I say any because you’re other opponent has to place their queen on the opposite bishop to theirs so that the queens aren’t aligned). The queen is the second tallest piece so you can’t miss it. The queen is important because it can go ANY direction as FAR as it wants. This is a useful piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king: you get 1 king. The king is located next to your queen. Usually has a cross at the top of your piece. This piece you MUST protect at all cost. If your king gets taken, you loose. The king can only move 1 space any direction. Making it very vulnerable. \n",
      "\n",
      "You are allowed to cross over your pieces with the knights and rooks (but some people don’t allow rooks to be crossed over your pieces because it makes your rook a bit overpowered). For the other pieces you can not just ‘jump over/cross over’ another piece. \n",

Qxh7 2.Nd2 Qh3 defending the f1 bishop, then 3.Bf3, threatening Bxe2 by exploiting the pinned bishop on f1.

I picked up this book after you had suggested it in an earlier stream. For those who are wondering what the book is like, the author breaks down how we usually approach problems and then gives alternative approaches, such as progressive thinking first, then reciprocal thinking, imagination, etc. For example, he will outline progressive thinking and then you must solve tactical puzzles. I think there were 752 puzzles in the book. The author doesn’t break down the thinking technique more than a few paragraphs of description and some diagrams to illustrate the point, then the puzzles hammer everything home. The solutions are provided for each puzzle at the end of the book, along with who played the game and when. Besides the correct line, he also gives the next most logical deviation and why it won’t work. I recommend setting up a board for each puzzle but don’t move the pieces to find the solutions. Limit yourself to what you can do during a game and practice your visualization skills.  Good book and definitely helpful for a wide rating range as the puzzles vary in difficulty\n",

I've seen 2 or 3 videos and saddly it seems to be not the case. Also the game is unfortunately too slow, they could have made it more fluid, when i see any piece which have to replaced themselves between every battle animation it feels just not good. Too bad those kind of game looks promising, and i remember that i used to watch my cousin and my older brother playing the 1st game in past, the idea to add animation to chess is just fun.\n",
